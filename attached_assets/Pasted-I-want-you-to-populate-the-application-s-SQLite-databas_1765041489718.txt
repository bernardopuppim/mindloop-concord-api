I want you to populate the application's SQLite database with realistic sample data so that dashboards, reports, and charts can be visually evaluated.
Please generate a full dataset appropriate for a contract management system of a medium-sized service provider.

Populate the following tables with realistic, coherent, and internally consistent data:

🔵 1. Employees

Generate 25 employees, each with:

full name

CPF-like numeric value

function/role

unit

status (active/inactive)

date of admission

link with service posts (if applicable)

Ensure diversity: supervisors, técnicos, administrativos, auxiliares, plantonistas.

🔵 2. Service Posts (Postos de Serviço)

Generate 8 contract service posts, including:

Código (SP001… SP008)

Nome do posto

Unidade

Modalidade (On-site / Remoto / Híbrido)

Tipo de Posto

Horário de trabalho

Escala / Regime

Quantidade prevista no contrato

🔵 3. Daily Allocations

Populate 3 full months (90 days) of daily allocations.

Rules:

Each day, employees assigned to a post should have one attendance status

Use realistic distribution:

85% Presente

8% Ausente

4% Justificado

2% Férias

1% Licença médica

Ensure allocations match the posts and employees

Include some days with missing allocations to simulate pendências

🔵 4. Occurrences

Generate 40 occurrences, distributed among categories:

Ausência

Substituição

Problema operacional

Notas gerais

Each must include:

date

description

category

optional employee link

Spread occurrences across the last 60 days.

🔵 5. Documents

Generate 50 sample documents with metadata only (file paths can be placeholders), including:

Categoria (Atestados, Relatórios, Evidências de Posto, Certidões, Treinamentos)

Mês de referência

Data de upload

Employee or Post link

Expiration date (some expired, some expiring soon)

🔵 6. Alerts / Notifications

Auto-generate pending items:

documents expired

documents expiring in 30 days

employees without allocation

occurrences marked as unresolved

🔵 7. Integrity Requirements

All data must respect foreign keys

Dashboards must immediately show charts, counts, alerts, and trends

Reports must generate meaningful content

The data must be good enough for a live demonstration

✔ When finished, present:

Summary of how many items were inserted into each table

Instructions for resetting or re-running the seed if needed

Confirmation that dashboards are now populated
